"""Reasoning module for Sigil v2 framework.

This module implements hierarchical reasoning with multiple strategies:
- Strategy selection based on task characteristics
- Strategy composition for complex reasoning
- Performance tracking for strategy optimization

Key Components:
    - ReasoningEngine: Coordinates strategy selection and execution
    - StrategyRegistry: Registry of available strategies
    - StrategySelector: Selects optimal strategy for task

TODO: Export ReasoningEngine once implemented
TODO: Export strategy classes once implemented
