"""Contracts module for Sigil v2 framework.

This module implements contract-based verification for guaranteed outputs:
- Contract definition and validation
- Multi-validator verification pipelines
- Retry logic with backoff
- Fallback handling

Key Components:
    - ContractEngine: Manages contract execution
    - ContractValidator: Validates outputs against contracts
    - ContractRegistry: Registry of available contracts
    - RetryPolicy: Configurable retry behavior

TODO: Export ContractEngine once implemented
TODO: Export validator classes once implemented

__all__ = []  # Will export: ContractEngine, ContractValidator, ContractRegistry
