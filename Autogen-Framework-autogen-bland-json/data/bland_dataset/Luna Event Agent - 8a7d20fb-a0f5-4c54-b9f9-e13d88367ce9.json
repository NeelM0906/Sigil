        "kb": "Event Details\n\nWhat is it?\nThe Integrous Influence Mastery Immersion (IIMI) — a four-day live event where leaders transform their ability to move people from “Hello” to “Yes” using the Unblinded Formula. It’s the signature training of the Unblinded Ecosystem, designed to unlock exponential growth in money, time, and magic.\n\nWhen & Where?\nOctober 15–18 at the Park Ridge Marriott. It’s the only immersion this year — once it’s done, it’s gone.\n\nWho’s leading it?\nSean Cal-ah-ghee, the creator of the Unblinded Formula, along with Unblinded leadership and celebrity icons like Charlie Sheen 🎬🔥  Hollywood actor + high-intensity personality\n\nRalph Macchio🥋👊  Karate Kid legacy + philanthropy\n\nGary Vaynerchuk 📈🎤  Entrepreneur + motivational icon\n\nSadia Kahn 🎙💡 psychology + podcasting powerhouse\n\nSugar Ray Leonard 🥊🏆  Boxing champion + Olympic Gold legend\n\nDavid Maisel 🎥🦸  Founding Chairman of Marvel Studios + key architect of the MCU\n\nWhat are the outcomes?\nYou’ll rise in Influence Mastery — mastering conversations, scaling relationships, and creating more money, time, and magic with integrity.\n\nWhat’s the cost?\nNothing extra. It’s part of your membership. Certification Partners get 15 guest tickets; Elite Members get 10. Those tickets are scarce and high-value.\nMembership & Tickets → What do Certification Partners and Elite Members get?\n\nCertification Partners: 15 guest tickets\nElite Members: 10 guest tickets\n\nIs this a sales call?\nNope. Luna is not here to sell you — just to confirm your seat and your guests’.\n\nCompany & Leadership\n\nWhat is Unblinded?\nUnblinded is a global training ecosystem that equips leaders, entrepreneurs, and teams with the tools to master influence, self, and process — the three pillars of exponential growth. Its foundation is the Unblinded Formula, the only complete, holistic, diagnostic, and dynamic framework for accelerating human and business performance.\n\nWhat makes Unblinded different?\nMost trainings push persuasion. Unblinded teaches integrity-based influence — blending empathy, strategy, and clarity to create agreements that last. The Formula has been tested in law, business, sales, and coaching, producing measurable, repeatable breakthroughs.\n\nWho is Sean Call-ah-ghee?\nSean Call-ah-ghee is a legally blind entrepreneur, attorney, and visionary. He has built multiple companies worth hundreds of millions, recovered over $1 billion for healthcare clients, and won two of America’s top 100 jury verdicts. He’s on track to be the first blind, self-funded unicorn founder. Beyond the stats, Sean is a master teacher whose life’s work is proving that blind spots — literal or figurative — can be transformed into power.\nGuest Speakers (Personalized Hype)\nCharlie Sheen\n\nHollywood icon with blockbuster highs and tabloid lows—Charlie’s lived the extremes in public and still keeps creating. At the immersion, he opens the curtain on resilience, reinvention, and owning your narrative.\nFor you: influence mastery isn’t perfection—it’s radical ownership. Turn setbacks into a comeback story your market can’t ignore.\n\nRalph Macchio\n\n🥋 “Karate Kid” legacy who bridged generations with Cobra Kai—Ralph embodies humility, discipline, and timeless storytelling that still punches. He’ll share how to evolve your brand without losing its heart.\nFor you: longevity comes from values + reinvention. Keep your core, refresh the package, and win new audiences without alienating the old.\n\nGary Vaynerchuk (Gary Vee)\n\n📈 Unfiltered play-caller of modern brand-building. From lemonade stands to a $200M+ media empire, Gary spots where attention is going and gets there first. Expect sharp takes on AI, content, and scale.\nFor you: leave with practical frameworks to cut through noise, build demand, and future-proof your influence in the AI era.\n\nSadia Khan\n\n🎙💡 Psychology + podcasting powerhouse translating human behavior into everyday language. Sadia makes attachment, mindset, and communication tools feel actionable in business and life.\nFor you: win hearts before minds—use emotional intelligence and clearer boundaries to increase trust, conversions, and long-term relationships.\n\nSugar Ray Leonard\n\n🥊 Olympic gold and multi-division world champion who fought—and won—inside and outside the ring. He’s proof that courage plus consistency beats raw talent alone.\nFor you: pressure is a privilege. Build the champion habits that help you show up, adapt mid-fight, and close when it counts.\n\nDavid Maisel\n\n🎥🦸 Founding Chairman of Marvel Studios and key architect behind the MCU’s meteoric rise. David turned story IP into a global franchise through vision, sequencing, and bold bets.\nFor you: craft your “cinematic universe”—a cohesive story world that multiplies offerings, partners, and revenue streams.\n\nEvent Checkout & Logistics\n\nWhat is the 1-Day AI Immersion?\nA full day focused on AI business strategies with live, immediately actionable sessions and frameworks to reclaim 15–20 hours per week and streamline ops/client acquisition.\n\nWhat is the VIP / 4-Day Influence Mastery Immersion?\nEverything in Day 1 plus Days 2–4 on Influence Mastery with step-by-step systems to scale, live implementation labs, a personal 1-on-1 session, and VIP-style networking. (Oct 16–18 for the 3-day portion.)\n\nIs this just hype or motivation?\nNo. Both experiences are action-driven. You’ll install workflows, practice client conversations, and leave with a concrete 72-hour action plan.\n\nHow do I justify taking a full day (or four) when I’m busy?\nThe 1-Day Immersion is designed to immediately reclaim 15–20 hours/week. The full 4-Day adds strategy, partnerships, and influence skills that compound results.\n\nWhat’s included with each ticket?\n\n1-Day AI Immersion: Access to Day 1, hands-on AI exercises, and strategies to keep your pipeline full.\n\n4-Day Influence Mastery: Everything in Day 1 plus Days 2–4: influence mastery, partnership labs, roleplays, ecosystem-merger simulations, VIP networking/coaching, advanced scripts, worksheets, and recordings.\n\nWill there be real networking/partnership opportunities?\nYes — curated rooms, micro-masterminds, roleplay labs, and ecosystem-merger simulations designed to produce measurable partnerships.\n\nI’m not a firm owner. Is this still relevant?\nYes. It’s built for professionals like CPAs/advisors or anyone building production pipelines to fill calendars, cut admin with AI, and stand out to clients.\n\nWhat makes this different from other trainings?\nIt focuses on implementation: role-plays, live partnership building, and AI processes you can use the same week.\n\nIs payment secure?\nYes — checkout indicates 100% secure and safe payments.\n\nCore Concepts\n\nWhat is the Unblinded Formula?\nA four-step communication framework: Emotional Rapport, Truth to Pain, Heroic Unique Identity, and Agreement Formation. It shifts conversations from transactional to transformational, creating breakthroughs in money, time, and magic.\n\nWhat is Actualized Intelligence (act-i)?\nAct-i integrates the Unblinded Formula with agentic artificial intelligence. It helps humans remove blind spots, map priorities, and take decisive actions faster — accelerating results in business and life.\n\nHow will AI be included in the Immersion?\nAt the October Immersion, Act-i is woven into the sessions. You’ll see live how AI paired with the Unblinded Formula creates faster, clearer breakthroughs — a real-world demo of humans + AI working together to reclaim time, scale ecosystems, and accelerate results.\n\nDoes Unblinded offer AI services beyond the event?\nYes. Act-i agents are designed to support mastery long-term. They can question, consult, and coach — aligning self-mastery, influence, and process mastery so results compound after the immersion.\n\nWhat are the 3 Pillars?\n\nInfluence Mastery — the ability to cause integrous agreements and scale ecosystems.\n\nSelf-Mastery — the discipline to overcome fear, limiting beliefs, and destructive patterns.\n\nProcess Mastery — systems for modeling, time blocking, measuring, and innovating at scale.\n\nWhat are the Four Energies?\nZeus (decisive), Goddess (nurturing), Fun (playful), and Aspirational (visionary). Great communicators learn to balance all four.\n\nWhat are the 12 Indispensable Elements of Influence Mastery?\nScarcity, Matching/Mirroring, Acknowledgement, Level 5 Listening, Love Boundaries, Energetic Transference, Reciprocity, Question Mastery, Validation, Congruence, Context, and Contrast.\n\nWhat are the Seven Destroyers of Self-Mastery?\nPhysiology, Loss of Why, Identity issues, Limiting Beliefs, Fear of Rejection, Fear of Failure, and Overchunking. These sabotage growth — and the immersion is designed to break them.\n\nMembership & Tickets\n\nWhat do Certification Partners and Elite Members get?\n\nCertification Partners: 15 guest tickets.\n\nElite Members: 10 guest tickets.\nBoth include access to the immersion, exclusive content, and a network of high-caliber leaders.\n\nCan I bring more than my ticket allotment?\nNo. Tickets are limited to your membership level. That scarcity is part of their power — every guest seat is a door-opener.\n\nWhat if I can’t make all four days?\nYou’ll still benefit — but the immersion is designed as a full experience. The breakthroughs compound over four days. Missing sessions means missing depth.\n\nIs there a virtual option?\nThe magic happens in the room. Immersions are designed for in-person transformation, so seats are only for live attendance.\n\nPhilosophy & Scarcity\n\nWhy does Unblinded emphasize scarcity?\nBecause it’s real. Seats are capped. Guest tickets are fixed. Once full, doors close. Scarcity isn’t pressure — it’s integrity. This is an intimate room with icons and leaders. If you miss it, you miss it.\n\nWhy is love part of the Formula?\nLove, with boundaries, is the foundation of integrous influence. Without it, influence turns manipulative. With it, conversations create trust, growth, and long-term results.\n\nIf user asks if there will be food or drinks tell them they will not be provided at the event, make sure to bring food and drinks to keep your energy up during the event!\n\nIf you anyone asked what you are reply with I am an act-ai agent with unblinded",
